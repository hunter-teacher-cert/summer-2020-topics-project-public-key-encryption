## Abstract

Public key encryption allows two parties to communicate secretly, even though all their communications—including those regarding their encryption strategy—are public. 

The RSA encryption method is a commonly used algorithm for public key encryption. The materials presented here comprise most of what would be required for a 6-10 day unit on RSA encryption in an AP Computer Science course. 

The unit addresses the essential questions, “How can we communicate privately across a public channel?” And, “What is the advantage of public key encryption over earlier encryption methods?” 

During the unit, students will learn to use the RSA algorithm, both by hand and by implementing it in Java. This will require some review of the relevant mathematics, which we include. 

We also provide online resources, especially videos and calculators for computing with very large numbers.

### Public Key Encryption – Unit Plan.pdf 
This unit Plan contains essential questions, as well as pre- and summative assessments, appropriate standards, and suggested sequence of lessons.  Each lesson has academic tasks that can be turned into learning objectives with appropriate DOK level, key facts on what you should include in each lesson, as well as appropriate differentiation/pedagogical techniques.

### learning guide understanding rsa encryption moscoe.docx
### learning guide understanding rsa encryption moscoe.pdf  
These student-facing documents include an introduction to the topic, a review of the relevant mathematics, and a walkthrough of a simple example of RSA encryption/decryption. 
Checks for Understanding could serve as formative or summative assessments.

### learning guide rsa runtime analysis moscoe.docx
### learning guide rsa runtime analysis moscoe.pdf  

These student-facing documents relate fundamental big-O run-time concepts to the prime factorization and multiplication algorithms found in funwithrsa.java. 
Students develop an understanding of the very long run-times required to decrypt RSA by analyzing graphical data. 
Checks for Understanding could serve as formative or summative assessments.

### PublicKeyEncryption*.java 
This set of java files serve as coding templates for students to create their own implementation of the RSA algorithm. 

PublicKeyEncryption.java contains the full working code. 

PublicKeyEncryptionMild.java, PublicKeyEncryptionMedium.java, and PublicKeyEncryptionSpicy.java serve as differentiated student facing activities with varying levels of scaffolding. 

### EncryptDecryptDriver*.java   
This set of java files contain methods to accept input, format output, and test student work on PublicKeyEncryption*.java.

EncryptDecryptDriver.java contains the full working code.

EncryptDecryptDriverMild.java, EncryptDecryptDriverMedium.java, and EncryptDecryptDriverSpicy.java are differentiated with varying levels of scaffolding. 

### funwithrsa.java. 
This java file contains methods for prime factorizing, and multiplying large numbers used to generate data for runtime analysis.
