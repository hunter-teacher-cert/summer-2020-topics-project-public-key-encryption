"Medium" Version of Student Facing Task

Note: 
The methods used in this program to determine the values of n, Phi, e, and d, as
well as the method for encrypting and decrypting numeric messages are based on the 
RSA algorithm described in the you tube video provided by Mike Zamansky and accessible
at the following site:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8M2BTscoD4&amp;list=WL&amp;index=76&amp;t=356s

TASK:

(1) Complete the PublicKeyEncryptionMedium.java file.

(2) Complete the missing parts of the code below.

(3) Try using the public key, e, from the PublicKeyEncryptionMedium.java activity to encrypt
a numeric message.  Then try using the private key, d, from the PublicKeyEncryptionMedium.java
activity to decrypt it. Did you get your original message?
	
(4) Try changing p and q in the PublicKeyEncryptionMedium.java file. What are your new 
public and private keys?  Try using your new public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt
numeric messages.
	
(5) Have fun sending and recieving secure messages!
