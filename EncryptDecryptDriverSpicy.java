"Spicy" Version of Student Facing Task

Note: 
The methods used in this program to determine the values of n, Phi, e, and d, as
well as the method for encrypting and decrypting numeric messages are based on the 
RSA algorithm described in the you tube video provided by Mike Zamansky and accessible
at the following site:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8M2BTscoD4&amp;list=WL&amp;index=76&amp;t=356s

TASK:

(1) Write a driver that prompts the user to enter a message to encrypt or decrypt 
as well as the public or private key (including both e or d and n), and then uses 
the public or private key to encrypt or decrypt the message.


(2) Test your driver using the values of e and d from the PublicKeyEncryptionSpicy.java activity.

(3) Try changing p and q in the PublicKeyEncryptionSpicy.java file. What are your new 
public and private keys?  Try using your new public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt
numeric messages.
	
(4) Have fun sending and recieving secure messages!
